## ❓ Problem Statement
Despite having a large volume of transaction data, the coffee shop lacked a consolidated view to understand:
- Peak sales periods during the day and week
- Most profitable product categories and items
- Footfall and revenue across locations
- Customer preferences in product sizes and offerings

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- ⏰ **Peak Hours**: Sales peaked between **10 AM – 12 PM**, showing strong morning demand.
- 🥇 **Top Products**: `Barista Espresso`, `Brewed Chai Tea`, and `Hot Chocolate` contributed significantly to total revenue.
- 📍 **Store Analysis**: **Hell's Kitchen** had the highest total sales and footfall; **Lower Manhattan** had lower footfall but high average bills.
- 🥤 **Customer Preferences**: Majority of sales came from **Regular** and **Large** size beverages.
- 📆 **Day-wise Trends**: Highest sales occurred on **Thursday** and **Friday**, while **Saturday** saw the lowest.

## ✅ Business Outcomes
